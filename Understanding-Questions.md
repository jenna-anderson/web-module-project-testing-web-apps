# Understanding Questions:
1. What are some possible tests for this application?
* The component correctly renders.
* Error message is displayed if first name input is less than 5 characters
* Error message is displayed if email input is not a valid email address
* If nothing is entered into fields and the submit button is immediately clicked, errors display under first name, last name, and email inputs
* Once all inputs are filled out, submit is clicked, the info is displayed on the screen
* After the above point, if the message field is modified, the displayed info on screen is also modified
